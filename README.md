# Web Image Optimizer by Platense Digital
This is a really simple converter from any image file to WEBP

## funcionalities
The app is functional but can be better. I have ideas for the future but i have a lot of other proyects as priority

### That it has
- Convert files to WEBP reducing the file size without perceptible quality loss.
- Retrieve a zip folder with all the images.
- Drag and drop files.
- Progression message.

### That it doesnÂ´t has (and maybe some day it will)
- Detect when you upload only one file and download it without put it in a zip folder.
- Resize options.
- Compression options
- Word-less interface (replacing all texts with images and icons for better accessibility)
